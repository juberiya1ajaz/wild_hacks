# APP NAME

## 💡 Inspiration

## 💻 What it does

## ⚙️ How we built it

- ML: Python, MATLAB
- Frontend: React Js
- Web monetization: Coil
- Styling: Tailwind CSS

## 💲 Best Web Monetization Project

We also use Coil to create micropayments for the user to support animal rescue and adoption. The coil is a free, open-source, and open-source-compliant web monetization platform that allows you to monetize your website for a small fee.

## 🤖 Best Use of MATLAB

We used MATLAB to build the image classification model. The model was trained on the dataset of various images of various animals and their injured status. The model was used to predict the injured status of an animal, and also to identify the animal in an image. MATLAB helped us in the following ways:

- We used the MATLAB `image processing toolbox` to read the images and convert them to grayscale.
- We used the MATLAB `neural network toolbox` to train the model.
- We used the MATLAB `statistics toolbox` to evaluate the model.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- Using MATLAB to build the model was a challenge.
- Completing the project under the given time frame.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- We built the ML model using MATLAB.
- Implementing the model to the front-end.

## 📖 What we learned

- Using MATLAB to build the model.
- Implementation of MATLAB.
- Collaboration with other developers.
